# Introduction
OOPS is a powerful and flexible Object-Oriented Programming System designed to simplify the development of complex software projects. It provides a robust foundation for creating modular, scalable, and maintainable applications using object-oriented principles.

With OOPS, you can focus on designing and implementing your software's functionality without worrying about the low-level implementation details. This system encapsulates data and behavior within objects, promoting code reusability, making it easier to manage and maintain your projects over time.

# Features
1. Object-Oriented Design: Benefit from the power of object-oriented principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to create flexible and modular code.
2. Abstraction: Hide the complexity of your code's internal workings by exposing only relevant information through well-defined interfaces.
3. Inheritance: Create specialized classes that inherit properties and methods from base classes, reducing code duplication and promoting code reuse.
4. Polymorphism: Write code that can work with objects of different classes, promoting flexibility and extensibility in your projects.
5. Data Encapsulation: Protect sensitive data and provide controlled access through getters and setters, ensuring data integrity and security.
6. Modularity: Divide your code into small, manageable modules to make it easier to develop, test, and maintain.
7. Documentation: Encourage good coding practices by providing clear and concise documentation to make your codebase more approachable for other developers.
